# END-TO-END-...Deployment-

The Movie Linear Regression Deployment project is an end-to-end solution for analyzing and predicting outcomes using movie-related data. The process begins with comprehensive data preprocessing, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features to prepare the dataset for modeling. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed to uncover trends and relationships within the data, providing insights into key factors influencing the predictions.
A Linear Regression model is built and fine-tuned to ensure accurate results. The model's performance is assessed using metrics such as RÂ² and Mean Squared Error, highlighting its ability to capture patterns in the data effectively. The iterative approach to model development ensures both accuracy and generalizability to new data.
To make the model accessible, it is deployed using Flask, creating a web interface where users can input data and receive predictions. This project demonstrates a seamless workflow from data preparation to deployment, showcasing skills in data processing, machine learning, and creating user-friendly applications.
